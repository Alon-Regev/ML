# Digit Classification
Simple project, learning about neural networks and supervised learning. Implemented neural network from scratch using a gradient descent algorithm. <br/><br/>
Project contains:
- A training program which produces a file of the trained model (takes a few minutes).
- An interactive digit classification which allows drawing in real time.<br/>

- Simple digit classification from a picture. (picture should have a white background, like a paper).<br/>

# How to use
run Main.py from any of the files. <br/>
requires numpy, pillow and mnist dataset library for training progra (or you can use the already trained model).
